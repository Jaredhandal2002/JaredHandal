<h1>Network administrator(Information Security)</h1>
  <hr class="grid-2 center">

<p>My job as a network administrator was much more thought based then
Other projects. Our assignment needed us to make a password system for the Maxxpower
website,but without using Actual password programing system. I felt like this was the most
challenging project.

<h1>Policy administrator(business intelligence)</h1>
  <hr class="grid-2 center">

<p>As my last job I felt like I needed to do Better than the previous marketing team.

A presentation of the existing data on the maxxpower website, and with that data we made suggestions for the websites asiatic.As for our next project
We needed to analyze two data gathering applications and make a decision on wich
Would be useful to Maxxpower.
