      <h1>System Developer(appdev)</h1>
        <hr class="grid-2 center">

<p> As a system developer my team decided to redo the MAXXPower
Website entilary.The biggest obstacle was my performance, I had difficulty comprehending my teams design choices
for the website. The lesson I learned from my job Is that your team has to be coordinated, and
if one of your team members are lost then help them.

<h1>Network administrator(Information Security)</h1>
  <hr class="grid-2 center">

<p>My job as a network administrator was much more thought based than
other projects. Our assignment needed us to make a password system for the MAXXPower
website but without using actual password programing system. I felt like this was the most
challenging project.

        <div class="sp3_paragraph">
<h1>Policy administrator(business intelligence)</h1>
  <hr class="grid-2 center">

<p>As my last job I felt like I needed to do better than the previous marketing team.
I feel like as a policy administrator I need to be a leader. For our first project my team put together
A presentation of the existing data on the maxxpower website, and with that data we made suggestions for the websites aesthetic. As for our next project
we needed to analyze two data gathering applications and make a decision on wich
Would be useful to Maxxpower.
